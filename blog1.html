        <h3>I worked for Lenovo</h3>
        <p>There was this company, Premium Retail Sales, that got contracted by Lenovo to train staff and sell their product. It was a perfect job for me, because I was probably unskilled enough to work directly for Lenovo, but they were looking for numbers to be driven, and I knew how to do that. I started by networking with staff, which at first was difficult. Not long after I started, I found certain employees who I could consider friends. And friends sell for friends.</p>
        <p>Within five months, I practically had a full-time position thrusted upon me. It made learning the Python programming language on my free time extremely difficult, especially because I didn't realize that studying late in the night was counter-productive. I was doing things like traveling to Arizona, Orlando, and working at PAX. However, I was also struggling to hold my bladder in Boston traffic jams, working in places that were understaffed and apathetic. After a while, misery set in. I realized this was not the job for me, though I knew that from the start.</p>

        <h3>I worked for Datto</h3>
        <p>After 2 years on the job, I realized there was no more ceiling for me at Lenovo, unless a manager who I liked quit or got fired, and I didn't want their job, to be completely honest. In the summer of 2018 I got a CompTIA IT Fundamentals certificate, courtesy of a Mass Jobs program providing free education in the Lynn campus of North Shore Community College. By the end of the year, an old boss friend was hitting me to up to see if I wanted to work as his intern at a place called Datto. I declined, but after getting a crazy small bonus for being the best salesperson in the country, I reconsidered and took a giant risk. </p>
        <p>Lenovo sales was a great stepping stone for me, because it taught me about hardware. But Datto taught me the basics about software.</p>
        <p>I worked there for the first half of 2019, interning as an Operations Assistant. My boss, then a Senior Technician, had ample experience with tech, to the point where he could really learn anything he applied his mind to. At first, he gave me small projects to help free up his time on serious projects, which was fine, because one of his side projects involved using a $3,000 3D Printer. Boy, that was a blast, once I got over the anxiety of using it!</p>
        <p>Eventually, I was setting up users with freshly imaged (or re-imaged) Mac Book Pros, and the occasional Windows desktop. Unfortunately I was not focusing on programming at the time there, because I made friends with around a dozen developers there, some who I considered myself close work friends with. We would drink and play Smash Brothers, and if I wanted to talk code, they were game to answer my questions until I turned blue in the face.</p>
        <p>But internships don't last forever.</p>
        <p>Since the job was more geared around Operations and Facilities, I didn't get a lot of IT training opportunities in my internship. My boss was kind of hoping I'd stick around, but I don't think I was a good fit for their team, who preferred to communicate in almost bureaucratic ways. While my boss was big on ITIL, which led to me taking interest in it, ultimately, the job just wasn't able to offer an IT position at the level I was then at, so I pursued other positions and eventually found Robert Half.</p>

        <h3>A Quick Summer Detour</h3>
        <p>During the month I had off in July, I encountered a slight panic. I knew which direction I wanted to go, but I didn't know if I had the skills to make it there yet. I knew which position I didn't want to go, but I acknowledged that they were the only skills I currently had. I built up a decent amount of debt in the few years of trying to teach myself everything by purchasing tech items like laptops, desktops, subscriptions, books, courses and so forth, so I couldn't even afford to work a $15 an hour job anymore.</p>
        <p>I felt stuck but I didn't give up.</p>
        <p>So, I spent most of the month learning to code. I tried out for Holberton School, and though I got accepted, I learned that they could not offer boarding, which was a dealbreaker for me (see: debt). I explained my situation to a friend I have, a friend who happens to be a few decades older and owns an Insurance Agency. He had been looking for somebody to design his website, since he hadn't been free to do so in years. He asked me, and I resisted.</p>
        <p>In recent years I always avoided designing platforms because:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A) I wasn't trying to be a designer, and</li>
            <li>B) I felt like using drag-and-drop platforms were "cheating."</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Once he offered to pay me, however, I realized that this might be one of those "moments" where you either rise to the occasion or shut down an offer because you're afraid to fail.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, drag-and-drop websites are really easy to set up when you've been practicing HTML, CSS, and Python off and on for the better part of 3 years. I used websites to darken images, and used free-to-use images from other websites. I retained basic information I had learned along the way about UX design, and completed my buddy's website just as July was coming to a close.</p>

        <h2>Beginning of the End</h2>
        <h4>My Tenure at World Travel Holdings</h4>
        <p>As I mentioned prior, I got in touch with Robert Half. My old buddy from college was a recruiter there, and he set me up with the department that places short-term IT employees with contracts. World Travel Holdings, a company that deals a lot with agents and cruises, needed help with what they called 'ramp-up' and so I joined their team.</p>
        <p>I got a lot of good reviews by the nice ladies around my cubicle. Because of this, I was offered a full-time position. I declined at first, but after reconsidering the closeness of the location to my home, I accepted and WTH bought my contract off of Robet Half!</p>
        <p>I considered this a huge compliment. Nevertheless, I'm still 28 in an entry level job I don't enjoy.</p>
        <p>That's not to bad mouth my team. The first couple months at the job, I learned as much IT as I could before I became bored to death by it. I even installed RAM and swapped out the hard drive on my PC with a Solid State Drive to try and run a demo software of Windows Enterprise. My boss told me that training would begin in January, and that I wasn't expected to have to know any of that stuff. So, I've kinda just rolled with that. I've accepted that my free time is now my own again, but I don't really feel like this is where I want to be in the long term.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This year, I spent a lot of time reading about books I felt would benefit me by filling gaps in my knowledge. I learned more about how to focus, why we sleep, how we learn, ways to take notes, ways to communicate and listen, the love languages. I learned about ITIL communication and documentation processes, how insulin leads to fat, ways to get rich, and why I'm not getting rich.</p>
        <p>I realized that, after all these years of getting beat down and losing out on what I wanted most, I subconsciously accepted that I was "doing my best" and that there wasn't any way things could get better unless I kept working hard each day.</p>
        <p>It's so weird to fathom that working hard can be an excuse.</p>
        <p>I'm not perfect, but after reading this recent book on habits, I'm really confident that I can change myself for the best. I've begun coding again (first HTML, but once my website has a clean HTML structure, I'm going to get back into learning responsive web design in CSS). I have goals that I can tighten up. Right now, I'm just trying to code for 5 minutes a day.</p>
        <p>Once my website looks nice and pretty, I'll move onto JavaScript. That's why I'm only writing dinky websites like this for now, because I want to get into the habit of updating my GitHub.</p>
        <p>Once my website looks pretty and has programming language(s) incorporated into it, I'll look into preprocessors, but I'm not jumping ahead of myself. I know what needs to be done before this forced routine becomes automatic habit.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, I am going to balance a few things: learning to code, finding clients to design websites for, learning how to use Adobe, and a long list of other things. For career growth, my focus is becoming a Junior Front End Web Developer. I will not stop until I am hired, and I have bled this promise by swearing off Facebook and Instagram until I get my first job, which I've given myself 9 months to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>I know that I can get better, and I am planning on getting better. In the meantime, all I can do is try my best.</p>
