          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I decided to become a data scientist in 2017. After researching role requirements, I began learning Python. I read parts of Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw, deep into the night. I often coded deep into the night, and would wake up the next day overtired and miserable. I would then spend entire days working a job I loathed, eating food that made me feel like crap. And when the end of the week would come, I would have time to code again. But I would forget everything I had learned in the beginning of the week!
          </p>
        </section>
        <h2>Enter: <em>The List</em></h2>
        <section>
          <p>As the first week of 2020 nears an end, I am a completely changed individual. I am reformed. My coding journey has shifted. I still wish to become a data scientist. But I don't have the money to go to college, so I've decided to teach myself code. Once HTML and CSS are in my toolkit, I will learn JavaScript, Bootstrap and React.
          </p>
          <p>
		       The following books made me a better coder, but you’ll find that not a single one of them focus on coding! I stumbled upon something big with these books. Just as the world’s best runners first succeeded in running and crawling, so too did I learn to take baby steps. Now, I get to share these portals of knowledge and growth with you!

          <h2>1. Deep Work</h2>
          <p><em>Author: Cal Newport</em></p>
          <p>This book, in essence, is about the valuable skill of being able to focus in depth on one task for long periods of time. Newport introduced me to the existence, and importance, of flow state. I knew that coding was tough, so I often “rewarded” myself with social media between lengthy code lines. I would even browse mid tutorial! What I got in return was piss poor retention of anything I had tried to do. I felt drained. Unlike when I wrote poetry years before, I didn’t feel like I was ever in the zone. This left me without many coding insights. It was demotivating.
          </p>
          <p>After reading this book by Cal Newport, I forced myself to spend less time on my phone. I refused to check my phone until I either finished the book or stopped reading for the night. Once I became entranced by what I was learning, it seemed as if time flew by. I felt a deeper connection with the content, and felt like I absorbed more. I began to read more books like this, even though I wasn’t doing too much coding at the time since I had started a new job. I learned: less distraction + more flow = more success.

          <h2>2. 15 Secrets Successful People Know About Time Management</h2>
          <p><em>Author: Kevin Kruse</em></p>
          <p>I didn’t need author Kevin Kruse to teach me about the concept of time management. In fact, I was already very philosophical and considerate about our time on this planet. Despite my awareness of time’s importance though, I still failed to do what I dreamed of. I failed often, but had nothing to show for it. It turns out that, despite my understanding of the concept, I did indeed suck at managing my time. So I read the book.
          </p>
          <p>My favorite thing about the book is that the author tells you what worked well for others, not only for him.  The book focuses on techniques used by hundreds of athletes, entrepreneurs, and students.  Kruse's insights inspired me to put as much of my schedule on calendars as I could.  Pretty soon, I got a little better at using Google Calendar. Now I use a Kanban board. I would schedule times to read, times to code, and times to let my mind wander. Things were getting fun! I was at last getting <em>deep work</em> done. But at other times , I failed to produce good code even when I allotted myself the time to do so. I thought to myself, “what is wrong with me?”

          <h2>3. Learning How to Learn</h2>
          <p><em>Authors: Barbara Oakley, Terrence Sejnowski</em></p>
          <p>I had this theory that, if I learned more about my mind, I could become a sort of self taught master mind. I mean… what’s a neuroscientist? You don’t have to be a genius, or a person with a certain genetic or societal background, to be a mastermind.  I wanted to figure out why I couldn't focus at certain times, such as that one hour of the day I had available for <em>deep work</em>. This book taught me more than I could have ever hoped for.
          </p>
          <p>I felt so validated to discover that we have modes in our mind, such as “zombie,” “focused,” and “diffuse.” Zombie mode is like our habit mode. Have you ever noticed yourself 15 minutes into doing a habit you told yourself you'd quit?
          </p>
          <p>Focused mode is like our deep work state of mind. Think of those times you can concentrate and “get into” what you’re trying to learn. You can learn a lot when you have uninterrupted flow time. Mozart didn't write his masterpieces with a distracted mind!
          </p>
          <p>Diffuse mode is when our mind wanders. When you want to get up and dance, or surf the web. This time, believe it or not, is as important as focus time. Because if you can reward yourself with social media, a jog, or a TV show, then focused mode becomes a trigger. (More on those later.)
          </p>
          <p>I learned about these mind modes and much more in this book. I was also reintroduced to The <a href="https://www.developgoodhabits.com/pomodoro-technique/" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a>. Once I broke my studying into hours of 25 focused, 10 diffuse, my efficiency skyrocketed.  But I still struggled with only having free time at night. I retained less. I had to figure out why staying up past midnight, to code, would lead me to waking up retaining very little. So much of my efforts still felt like a waste...

          <h2>4. Why We Sleep</h2>
          <p><em>Author: Matthew Walker</em></p>
          <p>I have suffered from sleep ignorance for a very long time. Years ago, I learned about Matthew Walker through a Joe Rogan podcast. This guy was sleep-woke for sure. He caught my attention by mentioning marijuana's effects on sleep patterns. I’m an advocate for legalization, so when somebody brings up a “con” of cannabis, I research what they’re saying. As it turns out, he was correct about this and a hundred other sleep facts. So I tuned in, and realized why my sleep habits were so bad.
          </p>
          <p>It’s funny the way the world works. While reading Learning How to Learn, part of the book focused on the importance of sleep. I read that insufficient sleep contributes to a decrease in synapse formation. Also, it decreases the strength of synapses that do form.</p>
          <p>While reading Matthew Walker’s book, I learned so much more about sleep. I learned about how different animals sleep and myths.
         I grew afraid of the long term cognitive damage I was inflicting on myself.  I learned of correlations between poor sleep and diseases such as dementia. I found out that driving without sleep  is equal to driving drunk! After a while, I saw past the negatives of bad sleep and focused on the benefits of good sleep.
          </p>
          <p>I came to understand that we all have peaks of our day. I learned about sleep pressure. Now that I had a better idea of how to sleep, I time manage better for peak flow state. I learn better. At first I thought less learning time would lead to diminished gains. But after a while, I saw that I was also getting more out of the time. My synapses became stronger. I remembered more. My confidence hit the sky.</p>
          <p>With the things I had come to learn, I celebrated by reading an entire JavaScript textbook (boring, I know). But I didn't remember anything I read! Even with pages and pages of notes, nothing seemed to stick. So I thought to myself, "Why not learn about taking notes?"</p>
