          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I decided to become a data scientist in 2017. After learning a few things about the general career trajectory, I began learning Python. I read parts of Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw, deep into the night. I often coded deep into the night, and would wake up the next day overtired and miserable. I would then spend entire days working a job I loathed, eating food that made me feel like crap. Then, when the end of the week would come, I would be able to code again -- and I would forget everything I had learned in the beginning of the week!
          </p>
        </section>
        <h2>Enter: <em>The List</em></h2>
        <section>
          <p>As the first week of 2020 nears an end, I am a completely changed individual. I am reformed. My coding journey has shifted significantly: I still wish to become a data scientist, but in lieu of time or money to get educated, take a bootcamp or even learn on my own full-time, I have decided that I will first learn how to code. Then, once HTML and CSS are familiar beasts in my toolkit, I will manipulate their objects with JavaScript, simplify my processes with frameworks, and finally get my foot in the door with a Junior Web Developer role.
          </p>
          <p>th a Junior Web Developer role.
		The following books made me a better coder, but you’ll be surprised to find that not a single one of them focus on coding! I stumbled upon something big with these books. Just as the world’s best runners first succeeded in running and crawling, so too did I learn to take baby steps. Now, I get to share these portals of knowledge and growth with you!

          <h2>1. Deep Work</h2>
          <p><em>Author: Cal Newport</em></p>
          <p>This book, in essence, is about the valuable skill of being able to focus in-depth on one task for long periods of time. This book introduced me to the existence -- and importance -- of flow state. I knew that coding was tough, so I often “rewarded” myself with social media between lengthy code lines. I would even browse mid tutorial! What I got in return was piss poor retention of anything I had tried to do. I felt drained, and unlike when I would write poetry and flash fiction years before, I didn’t feel like I got into the zone, which really left me with a lack of value in what I was doing, as well as a lack of motivation.
          </p>
          <p>After reading this book by Cal Newport, I forced myself to spend less time on my phone. I actually began by reading the book, where I refused to check my phone until I either finished the book or stopped reading for the night. Once I became entranced by what I was learning, it seemed as if time just flew by. I felt a deeper connection with the content, and felt like I absorbed more. I began to read more books like this, even though I wasn’t doing too much coding at the time since I had started a new job. I learned: less distraction + more flow = more success.

          <h2>2. 15 Secrets Successful People Know About Time Management</h2>
          <p><em>Author: Kevin Kruse</em></p>
          <p>	I didn’t need author Kevin Kruse to teach me about the concept of time management. In fact, I was already very philosophical and considerate about our time on this planet. Here’s some crazy bro math I created for me: the male mind can fully mature as late as 25 years old. The brain begins breaking down in our 40s, so let’s say we have 20 years of “prime brain.” Once you subtract ⅓ of that for sleep, and another ⅓ for work, when you sum those minutes and hours into days, that leads to a little over 2400 hours. So in essence, the prime of our adult lives lends us about 100 days max of our optimal learning years (again: bro science). Despite me being aware of time’s importance, however, I still constantly failed to do what I dreamed of doing. It turns out that, despite my understanding of the concept, I did indeed suck at managing my time. So I read the book.
          </p>
          <p>My favorite part about the book was that Kevin doesn’t just tell you “This is what worked for me” (like this article does ahem). Through the wisdom and practices Kevin Kruse discovered, I was surrounding myself with calendars. Instead, the book focuses on best practices and patterns exemplified by 100s of successful athletes, entrepreneurs, students and more. Pretty soon, I got a little better at mostly just using Google Calendar. I would schedule times to read, times to code, and times to let my mind wander. Things were getting really fun. I noticed that time would fly. At other times however, I failed to produce good code even when I allotted myself the time to do so. I thought to myself, “what is wrong with me?”

          <h2>3. Learning How to Learn</h2>
          <p><em>Authors: Barbara Oakley, Terrence Sejnowski</em></p>
          <p>I had this theory that, maybe if I learned more about my mind, I could become a sort of self-taught master mind. I mean… what’s a neuroscientist? You don’t have to be a genius, or a person with a certain genetic or societal background (though I’m sure money and an academic education help out a lot). Still though, it took the recommendation of this book from a mentor senior software engineer for me to really find a direction that could lead me to learn about the mind. More than anything, I had wanted to figure out why it was that I could not focus at certain times, like that one hour a day I might have available for “deep work.” This book taught me more than I could have ever hoped for.
          </p>
          <p>For starters, I learned a lot about the synapses in our mind. I felt so validated to discover that we have modes in our mind, such as “zombie,” “focused,” and “diffuse.” Zombie mode is like our habit mode. Have you ever noticed that you’re 15 minutes into browsing the web before you remember that you told yourself you’d stop doing that? Or, back to that first book, Focused mode is like our state of mind when we are in flow state. Think of those times you just can’t concentrate and really “get into” what you’re trying to learn. Then think about those times when you can. That’s Focused mode. Lastly, think about those times your mind just wants to wander. When you want to get up and dance, or go for a walk. When you want to to absolutely jam for a bit to your favorite music or tv show (as an aside, those recently for me have been Octavarium by Dream Theatre, and anime such as One Piece and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventures). Think about those times when you surf social media, not because it feels bad, but because it feels good. Those times when you just can’t focus, even if somebody paid you a million dollars too. That’s diffuse mode.
          </p>
          <p>	Learning about these modes of the mind (and much, much more) re-introduced me to The Pomodoro Technique for the third time (first from a friend who was kind of annoying, second from the Time Management book). Once I broke my hour of studying into two sets of “25 learn/code, 5 minutes anime, music, Facebook, etc.” life got easier, and my efficiency skyrocketed. Still though, doing this late at night would lead to me retaining less the following day, and at a rather consistent basis. I had to figure out why, despite my hard work and dedication throughout the night, I would wake up feeling more punished than rewarded for my efforts.

          <h2>4. Why We Sleep</h2>
          <p><em>Author: Matthew Walker</em></p>
          <p>I have suffered from sleep ignorance for a very long time. Just a little bit longer than bad sleep habits, as a matter of fact. Years ago, I learned about Matthew Walker through a Joe Rogan podcast with him. This guy knew his sleep shit. Even though I had long given up smoking pot, he really caught my attention when he had mentioned that marijuana use could easily have a negative effect on sleep patterns if taken at night, and the same for alcohol. I’m an advocate for legalization, so when somebody brings up a “con” of cannabis, I research what they’re saying until I have a much better idea -- a belief, even -- that they are either right, wrong, or somewhere in the middle.
          </p>
          <p>Then, I put off and eventually, forgot to, look up his studies for a few years.
          </p>
          <p>It’s funny the way the world works. While reading Learning How to Learn, part of the book focused on the importance of sleep. I read that insufficient sleep contributes to a decrease in synapse formation, as well as a decrease in the strength of those synapses that do form. While reading Matthew Walker’s book, I learned so much more about sleep. I learned about how different animals sleep, myths about sleep, and sleep from an anthropological standpoint. I also became really afraid of the cognitive damage I was inflicting on myself in the long term. I learned about the correlations between poor sleep and heart disease, dementia and Alzheimer’s. I found out that driving without sleep is equivalent to driving drunk! After a while, I saw past the negatives of bad sleep and focused on the benefits of good sleep. I came to understand that we all have peaks of our day. For instance, learning when the sleep pressure is higher in the morning or evening is going to be more difficult than, say, in the middle of the day (more or less), once we’ve woken up and had our coffee, had our first class or just finished a workout. Now that I had a better idea of how to schedule my time slots for flow state, I felt empowered in knowing that those other times when I’d rather sleep, were times when I should listen to my body. Even though it felt like I was learning less since I was passing up more opportunities to code, I was also getting more out of the times I did code. My synapses became stronger. My confidence greatly improved with the things I had come to learn, but when it came to taking notes on a topic like JavaScript (or even sleep for that matter), even getting a good night’s sleep couldn’t prevent my compulsion to highlight half of every page for notes.
