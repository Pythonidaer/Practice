          <h2>I worked for Lenovo</h2>
          <p>I worked as either a cook or server for almost ten years.</p>
          <p>When I decided it wasn't for me, I was at a loss for how to get into the tech industry. How could I, while unable to go to college? I had a small history in sales. That wound up being all I needed to get my first tech job selling computers.</p>
          <p>Lenovo is a PC manufacturing company. They own an Android phone called Motorola, and have plenty of items found in places like Best Buy. I saw a job posting that sought someone personable, with sales experience and an interest in tech. That job description had me written all over it.</p>
          <p>When I first started, I almost quit. I was going through a tough emotional time, and thought the challenge was too much for me. I was close to going into banking! But the job offered me a flight to Orlando, and I felt compelled to exceed their ROI expectations. Still though, with confusing acronyms like CPU, RAM and GPU, I had no idea what hardware made a computer.</p>
          <p>My research began with notes. Some employees would insult my products, and I had to figure out why. I would buy computers to test out their speed and capability. Over time, I became knowledgeable of our product's features. Once I learned about the competitor's products, I became an award-winning sales representative.</p>
          <p>I would have stayed at this job longer if it weren't for my dislike of sales. I felt like people at Best Buy were mean. Since I was only a vendor, it's not like I had a team to talk to, or HR. Plus, I drove a lot. My diet worsened, I gained 20 pounds and my coding journey felt derailed. My spirit screamed for change, but I still didn't have enough developer experience.</p>
          <p>My big break happened thanks to my old boss from a cafe.</p>

          <h2>I worked for Datto</h2>
          <p>It was December of 2018. My old cafe manager was now a senior operations technician at a prominent data company. He saw my code journey on social media, and thought to offer me an internship. He knew it wasn't programming, but a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Earlier that summer, I took a night course to get an IT certification. Then I built my first computer, with the help of a wiz friend from Best Buy. This experience, combined with networking, was all I needed to land the job at Datto.</p>
          <p>During my tenure here, I learned that operations was not a field for me. I'm not a facilities or construction guy. But I was able to learn about IT. But that doesn't matter much when it comes to my coding journey. What mattered was the time I had outside of work to learn.</p>
          <p>Over the summer of 2019, I watched a series of tutorials on Responsive Web Design. Shout out to Kevin Powell, who has taught me so much about CSS! </p>

          <h2>Beginning of the End</h2>
          <p><em>My Tenure at World Travel Holdings</em></p>
          <p>After my internship ended, I got in touch with Robert Half. My old buddy from college was a recruiter there. One thing led to another, and I got my first IT contract position. They found me a job at World Travel Holdings, a company that deals a lot with agents and cruises. They needed help with what they called <em>ramp up</em>. I started on July 31st, 2019.</p>
          <p>I got a lot of good reviews by the nice ladies around my cubicle. Because of this, the company offered me a full time position. I declined at first because it's not my dream to work as a Help Desk Analyst. Luckily, the hiring manager convinced me to stay. He said he didn't mind if I used the job as a stepping stone. So, now I work close to home!</p>
          <p>I considered this offer a huge compliment. Even so, I'm still 28 in an entry level job I don't enjoy.</p>
          <p>That's not to bad mouth my team. In only six months at the job, I have learned a lot about how systems interact. But a lot of my progress came from replacing coding at night, with taking IT courses. So now that I'm up to speed with what they need me to know, I've been coding every day. And I won't stop again until I'm hired.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Last year, poor health led me to develop keystone habits.</p>
          <p>Once I started eating home cooked meals, I began sleeping earlier as well. Once I woke up easier, I recommitted to #100DaysOfCode. Skills I didn't have before are now in my arsenal. Because I think different than before, I approach code from new angles. I am growing, managing a bigger solo project and controlling my destiny.</p>
          <p>My coding goals are in a general sense straightforward from now until September.</p>
          <p>Once my website looks nice and pretty, I'll move onto JavaScript. From there, I'll look into frameworks and preprocessors. I know I'm a hard sell to employers preferring college students. But I am ready to wow recruiters with my abilities.</p>
          <p>I've set myself a deadline of September 23rd, 2020, to become a paid developer. The internet has an amazing assortment of resources. I am entrenched in the Twitter code community. I use GitHub daily. I have many goals and cannot wait to crush them all.</p>
          <p>Now that you have my work history and bio, feel free to reach out to me! I'd love to help you on your journey if you are eager to learn how to code. And if you are hiring, then I'm sure it's pretty obvious by now that I'm interested!</p>
