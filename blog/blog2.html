          <h2>I worked for Lenovo</h2>
          <p>I worked as either a cook or server for almost ten years.</p>
          <p>When I decided it wasn't for me, I was at a loss for how to get into the tech industry. How could I, while unable to go to college? I had a small history in sales. That wound up being all I needed to get my first tech job selling computers.</p>
          <p>Lenovo is a PC manufacturing company. They own an Android phone called Motorola, and have plenty of items found in places like Best Buy. I saw a job posting that sought someone personable, with sales experience and an interest in tech. I fit the bill.</p>
          <p>When I first started, I almost quit. I was going through a tough emotional time, and thought the challenge was too much for me. I was close to going into banking! But the job offered me a flight to Orlando, and I felt compelled to exceed their ROI expectations. Still though, with acronyms like CPU, RAM and GPU, I had no knowledge of the hardware containers I was selling.</p>
          <p>My research began with notes. Some employees would insult my products, and I had to figure out why. I would buy computers to test out their speed and capability. Over time, I became knowledgeable of our product's features. Once I learned about the competitor's products, I became an award-winning representative.</p>
          <p>I would have stayed at this job longer if it weren't for my dislike of sales. I felt like people at Best Buy were mean. Since I was only a vendor, it's not like I had a team to talk to, or HR. Plus, I drove a lot. My diet worsened, I gained 20 pounds and my coding journey felt derailed. My spirit screamed for change, but I still didn't have enough developer experience.</p>
          <p>My big break happened thanks to my old boss from a cafe.</p>

          <h2>I worked for Datto</h2>
          <p>It was December of 2018. My old cafe manager was now a senior operations technician at a prominent data company. He saw my code journey on social media, and thought to offer me an internship. He knew it wasn't programming, but a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Earlier that summer, I took a night course to get an IT certification. Then I built my first computer, with the help of a wiz friend from Best Buy. This experience, combined with networking, was all I needed to land the job at Datto.</p>
          <p>During my tenure here, I learned that operations was not a field for me. I'm not a facilities or construction guy. However, I learned about IT. But that doesn't matter much when it comes to my coding journey. What mattered was the time I had outside of work to learn.</p>
          <p>Over the summer of 2019, I watched a series of tutorials on Responsive Web Design. Shout out to Kevin Powell, who has taught me so much about CSS! </p>

          <h2>A Quick Summer Detour</h2>
          <p>During the month I had off in July, I encountered a slight panic. I knew which direction I wanted to go, but I didn't know if I had the skills to make it there yet. I knew which position I didn't want to go, but I acknowledged that they were the only skills I currently had. I built up a decent amount of debt in the few years of trying to teach myself everything by purchasing tech items like laptops, desktops, subscriptions, books, courses and so forth, so I couldn't even afford to work a $15 an hour job anymore.</p>
          <p>I felt stuck but I didn't give up.</p>
          <p>So, I spent most of the month learning to code. I tried out for Holberton School, and though I got accepted, I learned that they could not offer boarding, which was a dealbreaker for me (see: debt). I explained my situation to a friend I have, a friend who happens to be a few decades older and owns an Insurance Agency. He had been looking for somebody to design his website, since he hadn't been free to do so in years. He asked me, and I resisted.</p>
          <p>In recent years I always avoided designing platforms because:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A) I wasn't trying to be a designer, and</li>
              <li>B) I felt like using drag and drop platforms were "cheating."</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Once he offered to pay me, however, I realized that this might be one of those "moments" where you either rise to the occasion or shut down an offer because you're afraid to fail.</p>
          <p>As it turned out, drag and drop websites are really easy to set up when you've been practicing HTML, CSS, and Python off and on for the better part of 3 years. I used websites to darken images, and used free to use images from other websites. I retained basic information I had learned along the way about UX design, and completed my buddy's website just as July was coming to a close.</p>

          <h2>Beginning of the End</h2>
          <p><b><em>My Tenure at World Travel Holdings</em></b></p>
          <p>As I mentioned prior, I got in touch with Robert Half. My old buddy from college was a recruiter there, and he set me up with the department that places short term IT employees with contracts. World Travel Holdings, a company that deals a lot with agents and cruises, needed help with what they called 'ramp up' and so I joined their team.</p>
          <p>I got a lot of good reviews by the nice ladies around my cubicle. Because of this, I was offered a full time position. I declined at first, but after reconsidering the closeness of the location to my home, I accepted and WTH bought my contract off of Robet Half!</p>
          <p>I considered this a huge compliment. Nevertheless, I'm still 28 in an entry level job I don't enjoy.</p>
          <p>That's not to bad mouth my team. The first couple months at the job, I learned as much IT as I could before I became bored to death by it. I even installed RAM and swapped out the hard drive on my PC with a Solid State Drive to try and run a demo software of Windows Enterprise. My boss told me that training would begin in January, and that I wasn't expected to have to know any of that stuff. So, I've kinda just rolled with that. I've accepted that my free time is now my own again, but I don't really feel like this is where I want to be in the long term.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>This year, I spent a lot of time reading about books I felt would benefit me by filling gaps in my knowledge. I learned more about how to focus, why we sleep, how we learn, ways to take notes, ways to communicate and listen, the love languages. I learned about ITIL communication and documentation processes, how insulin leads to fat, ways to get rich, and why I'm not getting rich.</p>
          <p>I realized that, after all these years of getting beat down and losing out on what I wanted most, I subconsciously accepted that I was "doing my best" and that there wasn't any way things could get better unless I kept working hard each day.</p>
          <p>It's so weird to fathom that working hard can be an excuse.</p>
          <p>I'm not perfect, but after reading this recent book on habits, I'm really confident that I can change myself for the best. I've begun coding again (first HTML, but once my website has a clean HTML structure, I'm going to get back into learning responsive web design in CSS). I have goals that I can tighten up. Right now, I'm just trying to code for 5 minutes a day.</p>
          <p>Once my website looks nice and pretty, I'll move onto JavaScript. That's why I'm only writing dinky websites like this for now, because I want to get into the habit of updating my GitHub.</p>
          <p>Once my website looks pretty and has programming language(s) incorporated into it, I'll look into preprocessors, but I'm not jumping ahead of myself. I know what needs to be done before this forced routine becomes automatic habit.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, I am going to balance a few things: learning to code, finding clients to design websites for, learning how to use Adobe, and a long list of other things. For career growth, my focus is becoming a Junior Front End Web Developer. I will not stop until I am hired, and I have bled this promise by swearing off Facebook and Instagram until I get my first job, which I've given myself 9 months to achieve.
          </p>
          <p>I know that I can get better, and I am planning on getting better. In the meantime, all I can do is try my best.</p>
