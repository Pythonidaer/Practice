          <h2>I worked for Lenovo</h2>
          <p>I worked as either a cook or server for almost ten years.</p>
          <p>When I decided it wasn't for me, I was at a loss for how to get into the tech industry. How could I, while unable to go to college? I had a small history in sales. That wound up being all I needed to get my first tech job selling computers.</p>
          <p>Lenovo is a PC manufacturing company. They own an Android phone called Motorola, and have plenty of items found in places like Best Buy. I saw a job posting that sought someone personable, with sales experience and an interest in tech. I fit the bill.</p>
          <p>When I first started, I almost quit. I was going through a tough emotional time, and thought the challenge was too much for me. I was close to going into banking! But the job offered me a flight to Orlando, and I felt compelled to exceed their ROI expectations. Still though, with acronyms like CPU, RAM and GPU, I had no knowledge of the hardware containers I was selling.</p>
          <p>My research began with notes. Some employees would insult my products, and I had to figure out why. I would buy computers to test out their speed and capability. Over time, I became knowledgeable of our product's features. Once I learned about the competitor's products, I became an award-winning representative.</p>
          <p>I would have stayed at this job longer if it weren't for my dislike of sales. I felt like people at Best Buy were mean. Since I was only a vendor, it's not like I had a team to talk to, or HR. Plus, I drove a lot. My diet worsened, I gained 20 pounds and my coding journey felt derailed. My spirit screamed for change, but I still didn't have enough developer experience.</p>
          <p>My big break happened thanks to my old boss from a cafe.</p>

          <h2>I worked for Datto</h2>
          <p>It was December of 2018. My old cafe manager was now a senior operations technician at a prominent data company. He saw my code journey on social media, and thought to offer me an internship. He knew it wasn't programming, but a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Earlier that summer, I took a night course to get an IT certification. Then I built my first computer, with the help of a wiz friend from Best Buy. This experience, combined with networking, was all I needed to land the job at Datto.</p>
          <p>During my tenure here, I learned that operations was not a field for me. I'm not a facilities or construction guy. But I was able to learn about IT. But that doesn't matter much when it comes to my coding journey. What mattered was the time I had outside of work to learn.</p>
          <p>Over the summer of 2019, I watched a series of tutorials on Responsive Web Design. Shout out to Kevin Powell, who has taught me so much about CSS! </p>

          <h2>Beginning of the End</h2>
          <p><em>My Tenure at World Travel Holdings</em></p>
          <p>After my internship ended, I got in touch with Robert Half. My old buddy from college was a recruiter there. One thing led to another, and I got my first IT contract position. They found me a job at World Travel Holdings, a company that deals a lot with agents and cruises. They needed help with what they called <em>ramp up</em>. I started on July 31st.</p>
          <p>I got a lot of good reviews by the nice ladies around my cubicle. Because of this, they offered me a full time position. I declined at first because it's not my dream to work IT. Luckily, the hiring manager convinced me to stay. He said he didn't mind if I used the job as a stepping stone. So, now I work close to home!</p>
          <p>I considered this a huge compliment. Even so, I'm still 28 in an entry level job I don't enjoy.</p>
          <p>That's not to bad mouth my team. The first couple months at the job, I learned as much IT as I could before I became bored to death by it. Still, I installed a demo of Windows Enterprise at home, to learn about servers. This may not be my preferred career, but it again gives me time to teach myself code.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>This year, I spent a lot of time reading about books I felt would benefit me by filling gaps in my knowledge. I learned more about how to focus, why we sleep, how we learn, ways to take notes, ways to communicate and listen, the love languages. I learned about ITIL communication and documentation processes, how insulin leads to fat, ways to get rich, and why I'm not getting rich.</p>
          <p>I realized that, after all these years of getting beat down and losing out on what I wanted most, I subconsciously accepted that I was "doing my best" and that there wasn't any way things could get better unless I kept working hard each day.</p>
          <p>It's so weird to fathom that working hard can be an excuse.</p>
          <p>I'm not perfect, but after reading this recent book on habits, I'm really confident that I can change myself for the best. I've begun coding again (first HTML, but once my website has a clean HTML structure, I'm going to get back into learning responsive web design in CSS). I have goals that I can tighten up. Right now, I'm just trying to code for 5 minutes a day.</p>
          <p>Once my website looks nice and pretty, I'll move onto JavaScript. That's why I'm only writing dinky websites like this for now, because I want to get into the habit of updating my GitHub.</p>
          <p>Once my website looks pretty and has programming language(s) incorporated into it, I'll look into preprocessors, but I'm not jumping ahead of myself. I know what needs to be done before this forced routine becomes automatic habit.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, I am going to balance a few things: learning to code, finding clients to design websites for, learning how to use Adobe, and a long list of other things. For career growth, my focus is becoming a Junior Front End Web Developer. I will not stop until I am hired, and I have bled this promise by swearing off Facebook and Instagram until I get my first job, which I've given myself 9 months to achieve.
          </p>
          <p>I know that I can get better, and I am planning on getting better. In the meantime, all I can do is try my best.</p>
