          <h2>Growing Up</h2>
          <p>I grew up with no passion in particular. Sure, I played computer games, but I had no career aspirations.</p>
          <p>In high school, I enjoyed writing poetry in detention. I got a fast food job at the end of my junior year. This path evolved into a supervisor job at a restaurant when I was 19. The food making was fun, but the pay was terrible. I also injured my back lifting up large batches of pizza dough. I knew something had to change.</p>
          <p>I'm leaving out the personal issues that happened along the way. Let's just say I got real depressed in my early twenties. I would get out of work and read books at a local cafe until they closed. At first I only wrote down words I didn't understand. After, I began writing in a journal how I felt. Soon this blossomed into writing poetry again.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>On Books and Writing</h2>
          <p>Struggling with depression may have been the best thing to happen in my early twenties. It brought me to writing. Poetry open mic nights and so much more.</p>
          <p>Reading books about Buddha and neuroscience and grammar prepared me well for college. It was there I wrote poems for the school newspaper. My tendency to study early and often led me to graduating with high honors. Writing was fun, but to me it wasn't lucrative. I became unhappy at the thought of not having a career path. Of course, once I graduated and ran out of financial aid, I discovered my interest in computer science.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Forced Evolution</h2>
          <p>Sometimes evolving is fun. When I was sad and writing at the cafe, I read all the time. But it wasn't fun learning code until 3am after working 50 hours a week, driving hundreds of miles for work and trying to "will" myself to learn code.</p>
          <p>Recent science suggests that the whole "left brain, right brain" description is a myth. People do have their preferences though, as well as their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
          <p>My weakness was learning how to code.</p>
          <p>I'm sure I would have excelled in college without issue. But at this point, in 2017, I was working 2 jobs, struggling to afford an apartment and was always sleepy. I would code at night, struggle to memorize anything, then wake up and start all over again. I was a mess.</p>
          <p>All this changed once I started reading the right books.</p>
          <p>It took me a couple years, but I realized I was trying to learn code like I learned poetry. There might be syntax in both, but there's plenty of differences as well. For instance, we don't learn to code by reading books in code. Although that would be a nice idea. No. We learn about concepts by practicing, failing, Googling and coding again.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>In the future, I will write a blog about the books that changed my life.</p>
          <p>For now I will summarize the topics of knowledge that many of them gave me. I learned about the importance of focus, so I reduced my social media use to better focus. I read a book about how brain synapses form, and restructured my learning because of that. I read about time management, as well as the Pomodoro Technique. I learned why sleeping is so important. This revelation made me code in the mornings and the weekends, instead of late each night. I took notes on a book about taking good notes. It was very meta. </p>
          <p>Over the past 3 years I have improved my approach on learning how to code. This portfolio project reflects all that I know how to do. Right now I can say with confidence that I am a competent coder. I soon plan on saying I am a hireable developer as well. Know that this is my mission for this project. And this project has taken me many years to complete. My dream is to become a developer.</p>
          <p>I hope you have enjoyed reading this. Now, back to coding. See ya!</p>
