          <h3>Growing Up</h3>
          <p>When I was a young boy, I always assumed that life would guide me on the path I needed to be in. I grew up in a slightly damaged household, so planning for my future wasn't exactly a life lesson I was taught. I still had a loving family though, who supported me even as I made less than ideal decisions along the way.</p>
          <p>In 2009, I graduated high school and moved around. I couldn't afford much of anything! Not my rent, and barely my cell phone. If I hadn't run into a string of underwhelming luck playing poker with friends, I would have kept needing to "borrow" my grandmother's fridge snacks! Talk about lame. That all changed though when I got my first full-time job at a restaurant named Mandee's Pizza.</p>
          <p>This Pizza Joint wasn't all that, but it allowed me to get my license and a car. It even allowed me to be presentable to a girlfriend! See, things were okay for a while, but once a couple key losses happened (family losses, gave up my dream of becoming a mixed-martial artist, didn't find a girlfriend) I had a mental breakdown. Not like, a literal one, but, a fun one! The kind that makes you reinvestigate every fiber of your being, in attempts to figure out why life's circumstances are so undesirable.</p>

          <h3>Enter Books and Writing</h3>
          <p>I got wicked depressed in 2012. I wrote a lot of journal entries that you don't want to share with your friends. One of them somehow got read by the girl I liked who didn't like me back. Somehow... and on the same day she introduced me to her new boyfriend! Life was grand.</p>
          <p>However, one day, I kind of got caught between a self-intervention and... just being fed up with my own pity party. I was listening to music (Opeth, TooL and Staind, to be specific), and realized that these guys were sad like me - <em>sometimes at least</em> - but they expressed themselves on a platform that was much more beneficial for them and others. I didn't know how to play guitar, so after a couple "exciting" a capella open mic ventures, I transitioned from journal writing to poetry.</p>
          <p>I wasn't <em>terrible</em> at it.</b></p>
          <p>Every time I read a word in a book I liked or didn't understand, I tried to use it. I read books on poetry, so I learned about things like rhythms and meters, similes and metaphors. I've forgotten so much by now, but the main point is that learning how to passionately read and write prepared me super-well for starting college in 2013.</p>
          <p>I'm gonna let my story unfold as I find time to blog and code this website. In the meantime, feel free to contact me on social media! Check the footer.</p>
          <p>Nice to meet ya!</p>
