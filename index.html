        <h2>Started From the Bottom</h2>
        <p>When I began working in restaurants, I was getting underpaid. I worked hard, but came to learn that the restaurant industry wasn't my passion. It wasn't meant for people in their twenties, not unless they were running the place. The pay was ludacrous! However, I lacked skills to get employed elsewhere.</p>
        <p>That's when I went to college.</p>
        <p>Luckily, financial aid covered most of my two years at Community College. Unfortunately, when I graduated I still had no idea what I wanted to do for a career. I began working odd jobs in sales, numerous brand representations (it's called being a Brand Ambassador in the gig economy), and eventually I got my first big break.</p>

      <head>
      <figure> ->
      <figcaption> ->
      <main> -> unique content to the document or app; doesn't include elements such as a global element or footer that are shared across a site; makes it clear to the browser which segment of the page it should focus on; a hook for a11y features such as the ability to skip navgiation

      Sectioning elements: each may contain a header and a footer
      <section> -> defines segments of a document that are neither a header, footer, navigation, article, or aside.
                -> essentially, a <section> is more specific than the <div> (spacing), but more generic than the <article)
      <body>
      <div> -> little semantic value; perfect for wrapping
      <article> -> reps a complete composition in a document page, application or site that is independently distributable or reusable "in syndication"; can be a blog post or blog comments; magazine article
      <aside> -> equivalent to a sidebar related to main article but could not stand alone
      <nav>
      <header> -> header of a document, can be used as a masthead, or beginning of a section; one per element
      <footer> -> footer of a document, can be used as an ending of a section; one per element
                                  -->
