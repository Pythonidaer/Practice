        <h3>My Website's Purpose:</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jonathan. I'm a 28 year old living in North Boston, New England, USA.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this website is threefold:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To land my first developer job</li>
          <li>To present my portfolio on a website coded from scratch</li>
          <li>To attract clients for web design in the meantime</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Bio:</h3>
        <p>The <b>TL/DR</b> about my life is that I want to do good things for this world. I'm not a carpenter by trade. I don't care about cars. I'm not a surgeon, but I do like helping people, and I do consider it a pet peeve of mine when people are suffering when there is a way they could not be. I carry that same perspective into organizations and society at large.</p>
        <p>I got into cooking for the first 8 years of my life because it was what I saw my family do. I then got into sales because, again, my mother got me interested in it. I got really good at sales, but I don't like that feeling of relying on commission and outbound calls. So, very slowly I transitioned into tech, my first independent career aspiration. And I'm still transitioning.</p>
        <p>After landing a job with Lenovo in 2017, I sold PCs as a means to teach myself about hardware. I didn't have a whole lot of time to code, but very early on I realized that being a data scientist sounded extremely cool. I mean, imagine finding an algorithm that detected gerrymandering? What if you could use systems and math and data to save lives? I tried to get into data science, but realized after several months that teaching myself Python (just for starters!) was a hell of a lot easier said than done. Plus, I still disliked sales.</p>
        <p>In early 2019, my old restaurant manager helped me land a job at Datto, a data storage company that's getting pretty huge. They hired me as an Operations intern, but my boss used this as an opportunity for me to learn basic IT, so that even if the job wasn't for me, I could then find a job in IT. It was an incredible experience! I learned a lot about development when I was there, got tons of book recommendations from a developer/mentor type fellow, played Super Smash Brothers in the Secret Room with work friends, and even got to fix an Ultimaker 3D Printer!. Once my internship ended, I got hired full-time at World Travel Holdings, where I currently work as an IT Help Desk Analyst, until my coding skills are up to snuff for landing my first developer job. That's about it!</p>

        <h3>Outro</h3>
        <p>These past couple years have been monumental for me. Not only did I improve my HTML/CSS coding skills - as well as my understanding of a variety of concepts - I also discovered why it was that my learning curve was so difficult to climb.</p>
        <p>See, when I was a young lad in 2012, I wrote poetry. I wrote a lot, read a lot, learned new words and grammar, even drafted some flash fiction. When I went to college, I had prepared myself for English studies and Liberal Arts, because it was easy to think, create, analyze pieces of work, and define words that I didn't understand.</p>
        <p>I made great mistakes applying the same learning style to coding and development.</p>
        <p>I thought that I could just learn all the terms, then code it afterwards, but it's not like reading a book, where you eventually just pick up the words. See, in programming, you create your own words, which is kind of like using a poetic license, but functions are a whole different beast.</p>
        <p>Also, if I type <em>i</em> instead of I, <em>you</em> know that I'm talking about myself. But as is often the case, the computer easily interprets this as an error. Or worse, it does exactly what you told it to, but since the error is implicit, you don't have any idea why your code floats left instead of right unless you know how to troubleshoot it yourself.</p>
        <p>My turning point was last year.</p>
        <p>I read this book by <em>Cal Newport</em> called <em>Deep Work</em>. The novel is about the ability to focus, in-depth, on one task, for long periods of time. I learned from that book that one of the reasons why I struggled to learn development was because I often altered tasks of coding by checking social media, drinking too much coffee, not thinking asking questions about what I barely half understood, and so on. I thought, "<em>Okay, so if I focus on one task, I'll learn more. Got it.</em>" Wrong again!</p>
        <p>I read a JavaScript and jQuery book that was over 400 pages long. I forced myself to read every page. I retained... most to none of it. 400 pages! Nothing retained! Was I teaching myself, or torturing myself?</p>

        <h3>Book Recommendations:</h3>
        <p>I've got to go for now, but I'll leave a list of books here that slowly improved my learning abilities and coding competency. I'll cover the rest in my blog sections.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport</li>
          <li><em>Learning How to Learn</em> by Barbara Oakley </li>
          <li><em>The Science of Self-learning</em> by Peter Hollins </li>
          <li><em>Why We Sleep</em> by Matthew Walker </li>
          <li><em>The Obesity Code</em> by Jason Fung </li>
          <li><em>The Power of Habit</em> by Charles Duhigg </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed the book recommendations if anything. Feel free to find me on social media!</p>
