          <h2>Who I Am</h2>
          <!-- I think I should change this area. -->
          <p>Hi! My name is Jonathan. I'm a 28 year old living in North Boston, New England, USA.</p>
          <p>I am developing this website so I can:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Land my first developer job</li>
            <li>Present my portfolio on a website coded from scratch</li>
            <li>Attract clients for web design</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Projects I've Worked On</h2>
          <h3>This website</h3>
          <p>This time around, I'm more structured in my project management. I'm designing with accessibility and SEO in mind. I'm using a Kanban board, and upload to Github daily. I didn't wireframe on Adobe XD. But I did jot down how I wanted my basic web structure to look before coding anything. I have daily journal entries (and Twitter posts, following #100DaysOfCode). The documentation provides me a clear vision of what I want to do weeks ahead of time. </p>
          <h3>The last version of my website</h3>
          <p>I coded <a href="http://jonnovative.biz" target="_blank">jonnovative.biz</a> in a week. I was eager to apply what I learned in a Scrimba tutorial on responsive web design. This was my first attempt at a responsive website from scratch. I didn't get far with this (re: <code>@media queries</code>) before starting an IT job. That's what one of my biggest goals are for this website. That, and implied basic features such as hamburger menu, display/hide toggles ,etc.</p>
          <h3>A daily caloric intake calculate in Python from 2017</h3>
          <p>This was my first venture into programming. I didn't understand syntax and semantics. I struggled to use iteration and loops. But I did succeed in connecting if-else logic to print commands. Although I failed to go straight from Python to being a developer, this project taught me a lot. I learned that seeing things helps me understand programming better. Once I finish HTML and CSS on this website, I'll practice all the things that confused me in Python.</p>

          <h2>Book Recommendations:</h2>
          <p>I've got to go for now, but I'll leave a list of books here that slowly improved my learning abilities and coding competency. I'll cover the rest in my blog sections.</p>

          <h2>I Am Determined</h2>
          <p>I cooked in the restaurant industry for 8 years. I excelled in sales. I have learned quick in my first full time IT job.</p>
          <p>I don't want to code on my free time forever. But I have dedicated the remaining years of my late twenties to teach myself how to code. This journey began with learning about hardware during my time with Lenovo.</p>
          <p>When I began selling PCs, I didn't know what a processor was. That was in 2017. Before the end of the fall, I was one of the top sales people nationwide. By the end of my employment there in 2018, I was the leading sales representative in the nation. I accomplished all this while earning my first CompTIA IT certification. I began 2019 as an intern in IT. And since fall of last year, I have continued to grow as a Help Desk Analyst.</p>
          <p>Life has been difficult, but it has been doable. I have made great strides to improve my time management. The above accomplishments might not look relevant, but they speak to my resolve. I have not given up on my dream. I have refused to let life lead me astray.</p>
          <p>I code a little each day. I am currently focused on accessibility and search engine optimization. After I test my markup, I will make my website responsive.</p>
          <p>Once this website looks pretty on any device, I will begin adding features. My first goal will be to learn vanilla JavaScript. Once I know the basics, I will step back a bit. I will learn Bootstrap and React. At that point, I will have a healthy front end tool kit. I would love for you to hire me before then, but rest assured. I am working diligently to meet you in the middle. And each day, that distance becomes shorter for you.</p>
